# Binarize
Binarizing a picture to the terminal in python. An open source project that others can feel 
free to use. 

# Instructions

1: Open up binarize.py

2: Go to the terminal and change to the directory in which 'binarize.py' is stored

3: Paste the following input: binarize('trump.jpg')
A binarized version of Trump will appear. Note that 'trump.jpg' is located in the 'Binarize' folder. 

4: You may add any images into the folder and place it into binarize() to binarize those images. 

5: Note that the two pre-set images - trump.jpg and clinton.jpg - are adjusted to 200 by 150 
pixels so that it will work within the constraints of your terminal. 

6: You may add threshold values (100-200 recommended) as another input when you run binarize(). 
You may also add strings such as 'PP' and 'XI' to replace the preset 'XX' and '  '. When replacing 
all presets, binarize should be formatted as such: binarize('clinton.jpg', 130, 'PP', 'XI')

Have fun!
